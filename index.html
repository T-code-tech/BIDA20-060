    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
       <p> Having started out as a small fishing village, Shanghai became an important treaty port after the First Opium War and was quickly opened to foreign influence. The city was soon divided into concessions independently administered by the Americans, British, French, etc. Even though there were specifically Chinese residential areas, a lot of people chose to settle in foreign neighbourhoods resulting in a mix of cultures and traditions that has formed Shanghai's signature character. The city became the centre of commercial and cultural activity in the country and attracted both foreign investment and migrants from other parts of China.
        
        Today, Shanghai is a colourful blend of glass skyscrapers housing offices of international enterprises and quaint little neighbourhoods with authentic tea shops and flea markets.</p>

            <h3>Let's talk about the life of the city</h3>

  <div class="text-box">
  <p>Shanghai is one of China's leading cities when it comes to career opportunities. <br>Money and money making are important aspects of the city culture. The use of cash is getting to be very rare. <br> The city is alive 24/7 and you will be able to order takeout and even get a haircut at any time of the day and night. <br> The rapid pace of life is a trait shared by most big cities, but Shanghai is notoriously fast.

You will see people on streets starting from early as four oçlock in the morning and  <br> the hustle doesn't quite down until late in the night. People in this city talk about money a lot and you should expect questions relating to your salary, rent, expenses etc. which are not considered rude <br> The stark contrast of posh high rises and small traditional lane houses is exaggerated even further by the striking contrast of <br> luxury high rises with tradional lane homes.
